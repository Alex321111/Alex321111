- 👋 Hi, I am currently studying at the School of Code, participating in their national bootcamp and fulfilling my goal to become a full-stack engineer.
- 
- 👀 I am eager to witness ideas evolve into projects through the power of code and I am excited to bring these ideas into life with my input and continue to learn on this lifelong journey.
- 
-  Outside of coding, my interests include sports, travel and arts.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NextJS and TailwindCSS.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open-source projects where my skill level enables me to make meaningful contributions.
