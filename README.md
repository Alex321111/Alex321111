- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alexandra! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a passionate and dedicated Full-Stack Engineer, currently building open-source projects after completing the School of Code national bootcamp. My goal is to bring creative ideas to life through clean, scalable, and efficient code, while continuously growing and developing my knowledge.

    ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m fascinated by the process of turning ideas into fully functioning projects. My focus is on both front-end and back-end technologies, and Iâ€™m eager to make an impact in every phase of development.

    ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m diving deeper into Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and strengthening my skills in JavaScript. Iâ€™m always looking to learn new tools and frameworks that help me become a better developer.

    ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m actively seeking collaborative opportunities on open-source projects or team projects where I can contribute meaningfully and continue to level up as a full-stack engineer. Whether it's tackling challenges with UI/UX or optimizing backend performance, Iâ€™m ready to contribute.

    ðŸ’ž When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me exploring sports, traveling, or appreciating art in various forms.

    ðŸ“« Feel free to connect with me on www.linkedin.com/in/alexandra-n-b4397013b or reach out for collaborations and open-source projects.
